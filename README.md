## 💎 Core Features

### 🗃️ Optimized Order Management

- **Packed Order Structure**
  ```solidity
  struct Order {
      address user;         // User who placed the order
      uint48 id;            // Unique identifier
      uint48 next;          // Next order in queue
      uint128 quantity;     // Total order quantity
      uint128 filled;       // Filled amount
      uint128 price;        // Order price
      uint48 prev;          // Previous order in queue
      uint48 expiry;        // Expiration timestamp
      Status status;        // Current status
      OrderType orderType;  // LIMIT or MARKET
      Side side;            // BUY or SELL
  }
  ```

- **Order Queue Management**: Double-linked list implementation for FIFO order execution
  ```solidity
  struct OrderQueue {
      uint256 totalVolume;  // Total volume at price level
      uint48 orderCount;    // Number of orders
      uint48 head;          // First order in queue
      uint48 tail;          // Last order in queue
  }
  ```

### 🔑 Efficient Data Structures

- **Price Level Indexing**: Red-Black Tree for O(log n) price lookup
  ```solidity
  mapping(Side => RedBlackTreeLib.Tree) private priceTrees;
  ```

- **Order Storage**: Optimized for gas efficiency and quick access
  ```solidity
  mapping(uint48 => Order) private orders;
  mapping(Side => mapping(uint128 => OrderQueue)) private orderQueues;
  ```

### 💰 Sophisticated Balance Management

- **Balance Tracking**: Per-user balance tracking for multiple currencies
  ```solidity
  mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private balanceOf;
  ```

- **Order Lock System**: Balance locking prevents double-spending
  ```solidity
  mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) private lockedBalanceOf;
  ```

- **Operator Authorization**: Controlled access to manage user funds
  ```solidity
  mapping(address => bool) private authorizedOperators;
  ```

## ⛽ Gas Optimization Techniques

1. **Optimized Storage Access**
    - Packed struct layouts reduce storage operations
    - Minimized SSTOREs through strategic updates
    - Efficient order data retrieval patterns

2. **Advanced Data Structures**
    - Red-Black Tree for price levels (O(log n) operations)
    - Double-linked list for order queue management
    - Automatic price level cleanup for unused levels

3. **Balance Management**
    - Lock-and-execute pattern prevents unnecessary transfers
    - Direct balance transfers between users within the contract

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Balance Protection**
    - Order amount locking before placement
    - Atomicity in balance operations
    - Authorization checks for operators

2. **Order Integrity**
    - Order ownership validation
    - Expiration handling
    - Time-in-force constraints enforcement

3. **Access Control**
    - Router authorization for order operations
    - Owner-only configuration changes
    - Operator-limited permissions

## 📊 Market Order Execution

1. **Efficient Matching**
    - Best price traversal using Red-Black Tree
    - Volume-based execution across price levels
    - Auto-cancellation of unfilled IOC/FOK orders

2. **Multi-Currency Support**
    - Automatic currency conversion for trades
    - Multi-hop swap routing
    - Intermediary currency support

## 🔄 Order Lifecycle Management

1. **Order Placement**
    - Validation of parameters (price, quantity, trading rules)
    - Balance locking
    - Insertion into appropriate price level queue

2. **Order Matching**
    - FIFO execution against opposite side orders
    - Partial fills tracking
    - Balance transfers between counterparties

3. **Order Cancellation/Expiration**
    - Removal from order queue
    - Balance unlocking
    - Automatic price level cleanup

The implementation ensures efficient order management while maintaining robust security measures and optimizing for gas usage across all operations.

## 📜 Contract Addresses

The contract addresses are stored in JSON files under the `deployments/<chain_id>.json`. Example folder:

- 🔗 **Local Development**: `deployments/31337.json` (Anvil network)
- 🌐 **GTX Dev Network**: `deployments/31338.json` (GTX Development)
- 🚀 **Rise Network**: `deployments/11155931.json` (Rise Sepolia)
- 🌟 **Pharos Network**: `deployments/50002.json` (Pharos Devnet)

To access contract addresses for a specific network:
1. Locate the appropriate JSON file for your target network
2. Parse the JSON to find the contract you need (e.g., `GTXRouter`, `PoolManager`)
3. Use the address in your frontend or for contract interactions

## 📜 Contract ABIs

The contract ABIs are stored in the `deployed-contracts/deployedContracts.ts` file.

**Note**: This file is automatically generated using the `generate-abi` target in the `Makefile`. Ensure you run the appropriate Makefile command to update or regenerate the ABIs when needed.

## Foundry Smart Contract Setup Guide

    amount,
    recipient
);
```

### **Step 2: Trade on Rari**
```solidity  
// On Rari: Trade synthetic tokens
router.swapExactIn(
    gsUSDT,    // 0x3d17BF5d39A96d5B4D76b40A7f74c0d02d2fadF7
    gsWETH,    // 0xC7A1777e80982E01e07406e6C6E8B30F5968F836
