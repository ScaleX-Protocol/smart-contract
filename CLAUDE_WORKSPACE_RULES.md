# CLAUDE WORKSPACE RULES - CRITICAL!

## ⚠️ NEVER TOUCH EXAMPLE FOLDER ⚠️

### WORKING DIRECTORY:
- **WORK HERE**: `/Users/ammar.robb/Documents/Web3/GTX/clob-dex/` 
- **READ ONLY**: `/Users/ammar.robb/Documents/Web3/Espresso/espresso-hyperlane-example/espresso-app/`

### RULES:
1. **EXAMPLE FOLDER = READ ONLY REFERENCE**
   - Use it to understand working cross-chain patterns
   - NEVER edit, create, or modify files there
   - It's the working example to copy patterns from

2. **CLOB-DEX FOLDER = ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
   - All implementations go here
   - All tests go here  
   - All changes go here

3. **CROSS-CHAIN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:**
   - Read working patterns from example folder
   - Implement those patterns in clob-dex
   - Keep clob-dex as the main codebase

### IF YOU BREAK THIS RULE:
User will be frustrated because they've repeated this many times!

### CURRENT STATUS:
- Example folder: Working cross-chain implementation (reference only)
- CLOB-DEX: Main codebase where all work should happen
